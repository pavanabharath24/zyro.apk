Resolving dependencies...
Because awesome_notifications >=0.10.1 depends on intl ^0.20.0 and habit_flow depends on intl ^0.19.0, awesome_notifications >=0.10.1 is forbidden.
So, because habit_flow depends on awesome_notifications ^0.10.1, version solving failed.


You can try one of the following suggestions to make the pubspec resolve:
* Try upgrading your constraint on intl: flutter pub add intl:^0.20.2
* Consider downgrading your constraint on awesome_notifications: flutter pub add awesome_notifications:^0.10.0
