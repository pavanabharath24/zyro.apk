**Headline:** Just built my own Habit Tracker using Flutter! 🚀

I’ve been working on this for a while because I wanted a habit tracker that just *works*—no ads, no paywalls, and no complicated clutter. Just something clean to help me stay consistent.

So I built **Zyro**.

It’s completely offline and privacy-focused (your data stays on your device), but I made sure to pack it with the features that actually matter:
✅ **Smart Alarms & Notifications**: Triggers exact-time alarms and notifications so I never miss a habit.
✅ **Customizable Icons**: I added support for different icons so every task and habit looks distinct.
✅ **Streak Calendar**: Keeps me motivated by seeing those active days stack up.
✅ **Clean UI**: Went for a minimal "Glassmorphism" look that supports both dark and light modes.
✅ **Detailed Stats**: Weekly and monthly charts to track progress.

Under the hood, it’s built with **Flutter** & **Dart** and uses **Hive** for a super fast local database. I built this utilizing **Antigravity**, checking off tasks and refining the code to get it just right.

I’ve open-sourced the whole thing. You can **download the APK directly** from the repository to try it out immediately:
