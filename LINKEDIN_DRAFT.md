**Headline:** Building Better Habits with Flutter & Zyro 🚀

I'm excited to share **Zyro**, a minimal and powerful habit tracker I've built using Flutter! 

The goal was simple: create an app that helps you build positive routines without the clutter. Zyro combines a premium "glassmorphism" aesthetic with a robust offline-first architecture to keep your data private and your experience smooth.

**Key Features:**
✅ **Smart Tracking:** Manage both daily recurring habits and one-off tasks.
📊 **Deep Analytics:** Visualize your progress with interactive charts and streak calendars.
🔔 **Reliable Alarms:** Built with exact-alarm scheduling and full-screen intent for a true wake-up experience.
🎨 **Dynamic Themes:** Beautiful dark and light modes that adapt to your preference.

**Tech Stack:**
built with #Flutter and #Dart, powered by #Hive for local storage, #Provider for state management, and #FLChart for analytics.
